Addiction is probably one of the biggest hurdles most humans will face during their lifespan, whether physiological or not, the latter may be characterized as bad habits, but I shall also use the term addiction to describe the latter due to their nature, I won't be speaking of the former as I do not have any experience with them, even if my analysis does apply to it I won't take any stance on that matter.

Addictions are the ultimate surrogate activities, they are the surrogate activities for surrogate activities.The need of an addiction is to provide a distraction to men,to satisfy all his heart desires whatever the means. The more satisfied he his the less free he will be to seek other means or to question the nature of his needs. The modern men is more and more pressed by it's addictions, full of needs, but without the capability to satisfy them all, he ultimately becomes miserable.

          </p>

    <p class="card-text">
The complexity that addictions brew on the mind of men will inevitably lead to rationalizations or to even worse to a change of mindset to accommodate this new life style brimming with demanding needs. If men finds himself in the former there might not be an escape, unless it's own life is at stake. It is only a matter of time until he realizes that this needs are actually harmful and that his freedom has been taken from him. Ironically men to cope with this he might self-indulge in his addiction to provide him a distraction from the reality. But at last the weight of his actions, the shame and the lack of freedom, might strengthen his will and he will want to quit.

          </p>
    <p class="card-text">
To quit it is imperative to rewrite his modus operandi and to get rid to his fake needs, simplification is key here, a minimalism of needs should be the ultimate goal. He must resist temptation and strive for a clearer mind.
          </p>

    <p class="card-text">
But then rationalization sets in, just one last time, after all what harm there is if it is the last time, just as men makes his decision to quit,  he has given in to the last time although he committed a grave mistake,he just ceased to resist to what he previously concluded as harmful and miserable even if for a moment,he arrogantly takes pleasure on this last time, unaware of the fact that he somewhere deep still lacks the drive and seriousness to quit, given his current actions, he convinces himself he will quit after that, unsurprisingly he will most likely find himself at his previous state.

          </p>
    <p class="card-text">
But next time surely he will quit, just one last time.
